        <p>Founded in 2018, Ultimate Lifting Club (ULC) started with a simple yet 
            powerful vision: to create a community-driven fitness hub where individuals 
            of all fitness levels could thrive. What began as a passion project by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/khadkasacheet/">Sacheet Khadka</a> 
            has grown into a premier destination for fitness enthusiasts in Kathmandu. Our journey 
            is built on dedication, innovation, and a commitment to helping our members achieve their 
            health and wellness goals.
